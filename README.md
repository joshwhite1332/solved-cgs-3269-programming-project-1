Using the MARIE computer assembly language, write a program that computes the following expression: z ÃŸ a * b * c. The computer will read in the input values a, b, and c   from the keyboard, and the final result (z) have to be displayed.  In addition, every time an input value is read in, it must be displayed on the screen. Remember that the instruction set does not have an instruction to execute multiplication. <strong>The program must be tested in the MARIE simulator</strong>.
